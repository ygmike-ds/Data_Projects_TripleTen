# Data_Projects_TripleTen

Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Working with Data in Python| The project task was to to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. |
| 2 | Instacart Orders | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. |
| 3 | Statistical Data Analysis | Analyze 500 Megaline clients' 2018 usage data to determine whether the Surf or Ultimate prepaid plan generates more revenue, enabling data-driven adjustments to the advertising budget. |
| 4 | Video Game Sales Forecasting | Analyze historical video game data to identify the patterns that make a game successful, enabling the identification of potential hits and informed planning of advertising campaigns for 2017. |
| 5 | Data Collection and Storage (SQL) | The main task of this project is to interpret and evalute the venture capital and startup data to identify investment patterns and generate data-driven insights that will guide multi-million dollar investment decisions for VentureInsight's clients. |
| 6 | Machine Learning | Develop a classification model with over 75% accuracy to analyze subscriber behavior and recommend either the Smart or Ultra plan, using the provided preprocessed dataset split into training, validation, and test sets. |
| 7 | Machine Learning in Business | Build a predictive model to identify the most profitable oil drilling region by analyzing reserve volumes, selecting the best wells, and calculating potential profit and risks using bootstrapping. |
| 9 | Integrated Project | Build a model to predict gold extraction efficiency using time-series industrial data, requiring thorough data validation between training and test sets due to inconsistent feature availability and temporal parameters. |
| 10 | Linear Algebra | Develop machine learning solutions for four key insurance tasks: customer similarity analysis, insurance benefit prediction, benefit amount regression, and personal data protection through obfuscation while maintaining model performance. |
| 11 | Numerical Methods | Build a fast and accurate car price prediction model for Rusty Bargain's app, comparing multiple algorithms (including gradient boosting, random forest, and linear regression) using RMSE while evaluating both training time and prediction speed. |
| 12 | Time Series | Build a time series forecasting model to predict hourly taxi demand for Sweet Lift Taxi, achieving an RMSE of 48 or less on the test set to optimize driver allocation during peak hours. |

### Results

Taking the time to explain my results at each step was a key element in this process, and this was my first attempt at doing it. I wrote an introduction and conclusion that outlined what I did, and made suggestions for all the projects to consider in the future.

Please have a look at the Jupyter Notebook included for a full description of results.
